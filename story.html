Broadband access improves the quality of education for special education students, experts say. Unfortunately, a report from the New York Law School’s Advanced Communications Law and Policy Center concludes that only 24 percent of people with a disability in the US have access.
Even as broadband service spreads across America in general, Americans with disabilities lack access to the services high-speed internet offers due to the higher concentration of disabled people in rural areas and cost barriers said Charles Davidson, one of the reports authors.
The US Census Bureau reports that 12.8 percent of Americans between 21 and 64 are disabled. This amounts to approximately 40 million Americans. 
The report‘s authors Charles Davidson and Michael Santorelli note that broadband assisted education offers a viable alternative to the traditional exchange between teacher and student—students can communicate exclusively through text or use a mouse to improve their in class participation.
Davidson and Santorelli highlight the crux of the problem: broadband access is spreading slowest in rural areas that also have a high than average population of disabled people. 
In New York State, this issue is starkly evident; New York City has nearly 100% broadband access. Many communities upstate have high access rates but rural areas are still lagging. 

Teachers who work with disabilities see the benefits of online education:
 “Some of my kids definitely benefit from the lack of distractions in online classes,” said Alli Doll, an online instructor at PA Leadership Charter School. Doll teaches both special and regular education classes. 
“I think my special ed. kids, especially the ones on the autism spectrum, get more out of the online class room because I can give them more time on tests or chat with them one-on-one when they need it,” said Doll. 
“That doesn’t even cover the kids in my regular ed. classes who have a physical disability that makes in-person schooling impossible. Online classes give them a fair chance to really learn,” said Doll. 
Leah Brown, a behaviorist and the founder of Potential Discoveries, a company that provides classroom and in home services for students with developmental and behavioral disabilities sees different benefits.
“The internet lets my clients explore their world in a safe way. If engaging in class is too much for them, a few minutes reading about something they like helps them to calm down,” Brown said.
Echoing Doll, Brown said, “it’s just about helping people with different abilities learn and share their talents with the rest of the world.”
